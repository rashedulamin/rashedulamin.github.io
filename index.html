    <h1>Hello, Iâ€™m Mohammad Rashedul Amin!</h1>
    <p>As a Master's candidate in Applied Computer Science at Schmalkalden University of Applied Sciences, Germany. I'm deeply immersed in innovating within Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and particularly Natural Language Processing (NLP). My ambition is to revolutionize how we interact with technology daily, making it more intuitive and responsive. This journey builds upon my Bachelor's in Computer Science & Engineering from ULAB and four years in software industry roles, including Quality Assurance and Project Management. My expertise extends beyond technical skills to a fervent advocacy for Security and Privacy in our digital age, shaping a safer, more connected world.</p>
